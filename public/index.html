			<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10px">23/11/2018</p>

			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
					Less than four months after announcing it would acquire Blue Microphones, Logitech is reportedly trying to make an even bigger purchase: Plantronics. Reuters reports that Logitech is offering as much as $2.2 billion in hopes of adding the headset maker to its ranks. If negotiations prove successful, a deal could be announced sometime this coming week, though nothing has been finalized.
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
					Plantronics would be Logitech’s most expensive acquisition to date and bolster the company’s lineup of PC and mobile accessories. Gaming peripherals have also proven to be a boost for Logitech’s bottom line. According to Reuters, both companies are trying to reduce manufacturing costs and minimize the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs on China imports into the US. Joining together is certainly one approach to doing that.

			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
					Plantronics manufactures a range of Bluetooth headphones / earbuds, office headsets, and other accessories. The company’s fitness-geared earbuds are well-reviewed, and Plantronics continues to release traditional Bluetooth earpieces years after many other companies have moved on from that segment — a sign of its foothold in the office environment. According to the company, Neil Armstrong’s famous words as he stepped out onto the moon’s surface were transmitted through a Plantronics headset.

			<h1 style="text-align: center;">How an Instagram conversation led to a firestorm in China</h1>
			<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10px">24/11/2018</p>

			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
					Racist Instagram exchanges have gone viral in China, despite the platform being blocked. A Dolce and Gabbana fashion show has been apparently canceled in China as hordes of online users accuse the brand of racism. First denounced by famous actors including Zhang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), the brand pulled its Shanghai fashion show last night after a dozen models left, and now, online platforms like Net-A-Porter and Alibaba’s Taobao have swiftly stopped carrying its wares in China.
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
					The ire stemmed from a series of Instagram exchanges between Stefano Gabbana, one of two designers behind the fashion line, and a model, Michele Tranovo, who pointed out one of Dolce and Gabbana’s ads came across as patronizingly and potentially racist. Gabbana appeared to denounce the model in comments, accusing her of eating dogs and name-calling her “China Ignorant Dirty Smelling Mafia.”
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
					Chinese users who caught the ad either outside of China where the platform isn’t blocked or through a VPN to bypass the firewall are now calling for a boycott of the brand. One Weibo user wrote, “The most annoying thing about this ad is that Chinese people only use chopsticks when it’s appropriate.” Another wrote, “You try eating Chinese hot pot with a knife and fork then.” On Instagram, some Chinese users have responded in profanity, calling Dolce and Gabbana a “bad brand.”
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
					With the latest viral scandal, Dolce and Gabbana’s use of Instagram as a marketing tool to lure younger customers appears to be backfiring, due mainly to a lack of cultural understanding. While the brand might have meant the chopsticks ad to be a cute nod to Chinese culture, it came across as rudely patronizing, and the harrowing comments from Gabbana’s account only poured salt in the wound.
